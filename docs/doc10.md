In future work we can, 

1. Identify ways to extend the activity recognizer to specific use cases like activity identification for elderly patients, physically disabled persons 
2. More practical and usuable product is the smart watch instead of cell phones, for personalization. A combination of both in case the watch is not attached to the hand can be used.
3. Design pipeline in production to accommodate the active learning training on device.

### Key Takeaways

1. Training with most informative subset is enough to achieve a good performance
2. Data collection is a challenge 
3. Wearable technology is closely tied to human interaction hence learning algorithms can actively query the user for labels.
