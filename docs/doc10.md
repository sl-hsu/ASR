In future work, we can identify possible solutions, 
1. To mitigate the gap in performance in the initial period before the recognizer learns about an individualâ€™s activity style. 
2. More practical and usuable product is the smart watch instead of cell phones, for personalization. A combination of both in case the watch is not attached to the hand can be used.
3. Identify ways to extend the activity recognizer to specific use cases like activity identification for elderly patients, physically disabled persons using active learning methods.
4. Design pipeline in production to accomodate the active learning training and build a recommendation system to identify the improvement in quality of recommendation over time.
