The major goal of this project is twofold, as highlighted in the introduction section.
They are :

1. We aim to identify the percentage improvement in performance of an activity recognition model over time for a single subject not present in the training dataset using active and semi-supervised learning methods.
2. We aim to identify how much can a classifier be adapted to account for sensor placement variations for a single individual subject.
