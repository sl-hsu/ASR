In the paper [**“Improving Activity Classification for Health Applications on Mobile Devices using Active and Semi-Supervised Learning“ by Brent et. al.**](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.176.4918&rep=rep1&type=pdf) , the authors compared the performance improvement of active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods about automatically adapting classifiers. However, this paper did not further investigate the effect of these augmented classifiers on the test set where the user’s way of performing activities differs from how it was performed in the training data set.
 
In the paper, [**A Tutorial on Human Activity Recognition Using Body-Worn Inertial Sensors by Andreas et. al.**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2499621) the authors discuss a case study on the influence of sensor placement on the recognition performance, using sensors strapped to different positions on hand and did not deal with mobile phone sensors.
