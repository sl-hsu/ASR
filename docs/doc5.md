In order to obtain our data to accomplish the two goals, we followed a series of steps to collect data from 7 participants. Our data collection pipeline is as follows :

### Steps 

1. We initially communicated the project's goal to the participants and obtained consent from them to record data. 
2. We completely **anonymized** the dataset by not recording their names, and *de-identifying* each participant as Subject 1 through 7.
3. We used android phones to collect accelerometer data from six participants and an iphone to record the remaining  participants data using AndroSensor App and SensorLog App respectively.
4. The participants were asked to perform the following activities and data collection was done for two different sensor placements, first the mobile phone was placed in the hand and second the mobile phone was in the pocket when the activity was performed. 

**Activities performed** : Walking, Jogging, Climbing stairs, Climbing downstairs, Sitting, Lying down/Sleeping, Eating, Drinking, Jumping, Exercise.

:::note
* Eating and Drinking activity were recorded only for single sensor placement(hand). Since recording eating activity with a phone in the pocket is similar to sitting idly and does not make sense to collect. 

* For exercise, the participants were asked to do any warm up exercise excluding walking and running, hence most participants resorted to doing simple stretches.

:::

5. Each participant recorded the data of each activity(for 1-3 minutes) with a sampling frequency of **100Hz**. 
6. All the participants data was collected and stored in a shared drive among both of the team members of the project.
7. We will be referring to the two sensor placement data as `hand data` and `pocket data` in the subsequent sections. This implies that the data was collected by placing the phone in hand and pocket respectively.


### Subject Statistics

The plot below shows the histogram of the **age distribution** of participants and the overall age spanned from **23-31**.

The next plot shows the **gender distribution** of the participants, in total we collected data from **4 female** and **3 male participants**.

The plot below, shows how many participants were under the supervision of either one of the project team members while recording the data. In other words **five** of them can be considered to be **supervised** and the **two** other participants were asked to record the data by themselves **without any supervision**.
