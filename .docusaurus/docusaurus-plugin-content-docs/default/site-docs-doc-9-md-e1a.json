  "description": "In this project, we leverage active and semi-supervised learning methods to prove the feasibility of the personalization of a classifier and to observe the degree of improvement with respect to the variation of sensor placements and individual differences. For example, we can achieve 70%-80% accuracy using active learning with the least confidence if 20% of unlabeled data (500 out of 2500 samples) are labeled and added into the training set. That is a huge improvement compared to the baseline classifier that only had less than 20% accuracy.",
